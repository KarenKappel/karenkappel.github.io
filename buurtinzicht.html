			<h3>Concept</h3>
			<p>This project came forth form a design assignment during my studies at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. The main challenge was creating a digital service with datavisulation at its core. This concept is designed as concept for the municipality Rotterdam and called 'Buurt in zicht', meaning neighbourhood in sight, with a play on the words in zicht en inzicht which convey that there is insight on the neighbourhoods and someone is watching over on the neighbourhoods. The main concept is that this site will act as an information source where potential buyers and tenants can see data that is decisive for choosing a particular neighborhood.</p>
			<h3>Design process</h3>
			<p>The main objective of this project was to visualise data in a graphically pleasing yet informational way. At first, I started by asking myself and others what kind of data they would wanted. After gathering their feedback, I concluded a lot of people were interested in the neighbourhoods they live, but had a hard time looking up information about it. This feedback later grew to a concept and with feedback from my project supervisor it grew to a platform were people can find and compare neighbourhoods.</p>
			<p>The biggest challenges during this project were, finding a way to combine and visualise large amount of data while still being recognisable by the average user, using a colour pallet that had enough different colours and could also be used on screens and could be sign by people with visual impairments, and staying in line with the visual guide of the municipality of Rotterdam. I chose to design for this city because they had the most data available.</p>
			<h3>User research</h3>
			<p>To make sure I visualised data users wanted and needed I looked at online recourse about how people buy houses and what kind, if at all, of research they did. I also went to different home owners and tenants to ask them why they specifically chose the house they live in and if they had the option of moving what they would do different. According to this research usres were mostly interested in the following information.</p>
			<h3>Design</h3>
			<p>After, and dusring, the user research I started sketching different concepts and based on the flowchart, the user requirements list, user stories, and the feedback I gathered during feedback sessions with the project manager, and the lead user experience designer. After sketching and several feedback sessions I started to create a clickable wireframe setup in Adobe Xd. I opted to create a clickable from the start, in order to find out if the flow from screen to screen was correct and would fit in the users mental model. After several feedback sessions I started the mockup with the corporate identity of Motek. I also had several feedback sessions with this mockup before I created a usability test and tested it on colleagues who interact with the users the most. Due to time restrictions on the users part there wasn't enough time left in the project to also test with them.</p>
			<h4>Insights</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Housing stock</li>
				<li>Types of public transport</li>
				<li>Scholing oppurtunies</li>
				<li>Type of house</li>
				<li>Valuation of real estate</li>
				<li>Available parking spaces</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Design</h3>
			<p>This is the main page where users can select one or more neighbourhoods in Rotterdam. I chose to use an interactive map so users can easily see where these neighbourhoods are located and see the size differences between them. After selecting some neighbourhoods the users can see the differences between them in three overarching categories and 18 subcategories.</p>

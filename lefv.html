			<h2>LEFV: Delivery with Light Electric Freight Vehicles | 2018 </h2>
		</div>
		<div class="projectuitleg">
			<h3>Concept</h3>
				<p>TDelivery with Light Electric Freight Vehicles (LEFV) is an application where users can track their parcels and drivers can see where they should deliver the parcels. Users create an account on the website of LEFV. When an order is placed users can connect it with their application and track their packages.</p>
				<p>The users can see all details from where and what time their parcel will be delivered, they will also see who the driver is and where he is during the delivery day. The users can then choose to either receive the parcel on the agreed destination on or change the location.
				<p>If the driver was on their way to another delivery, the route will automatically change to the most convenient route to ensure that the route is still as efficient as possible. The driver will not have to physically interact with the user interface, so he can focus on the road. This means that hubs or addresses are aligned in a way that allows the driver to drive one way without repeating areas. Depending on how long it takes for the parcel receiver to get to the agreed upon destination they will receive a notification on their device before the deliverer will arrive.</p>
				<p>If the user has a smartwatch it will vibrate and show the difference in time from when the parcel might arrive and now. The user can choose to either go to the agreed upon destination or change the destination one last time if the parcel is not at the chosen destination within the last five minutes of the delivery process.</p>
				<p>After the parcel has been delivered the user can check the application if everything arrived and if nothing is damaged. If a parcel is damaged, they can take pictures and use it in a claims report. The claims report will be sent to the driver and the web shop the user ordered from.</p>
				<p>The user can is also to write a review, however if the user does not want to or does not feel the need to write a review, they can choose to give 1-5 stars. With one being very bad and five being perfect.</p>
			<h3>User research</h3>
				<p>I focused on two different type of users, the user who orders and receives the parcel, and the user who delivers the parcel to the place the recipient user desires. According to Bevolking Meter 95 per cent of Dutch citizens use the internet, and 93 per cent made an online purchase in 2015. This means the application has a lot of potential to be successful in the Netherlands.</p>
				<p>I also focused on making the application inclusive to users with visual impairments that use iPhones. I chose to focus on this audience because there are 350 thousand citizens with a visual impairment in both eyes in the Netherlands, according to het Oogfonds. They also expect that between 2010 and 2020 this number will increase by 20 per cent.</p>
			<h3>Insights</h3>
				<p>After conducting interviews I created a user requirement list, user stories, and started sketching.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Know when and where the parcel will arrive.</li>
					<li>Use a colour pallet that has enough contrast.</li>
					<li>Know when I ordered the parcel and from wich webshop.</li>
					<li>Being able to drive a route without having to physcally interact with the device a lot.</li>
					<li>Being able to follow the development of a dispute.</li>
				</ul>

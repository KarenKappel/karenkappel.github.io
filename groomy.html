			<h2>Groomy | Case study | 2024 </h2>

				<h3>Concept</h3>
				<p>Groomy was born out of the desire to address a personal challenge I faced with maintaining a consistent grooming routine for my dog, Atlas. As a busy pet owner, I found it difficult to keep up with all the necessary care tasks, especially while balancing other responsibilities. This realization led to the idea of designing a light-hearted, yet practical, application that could support pet owners like myself in managing their dog's care activities.</p>
				<p>The vision for Groomy was to create something more than just a utility — it needed to be cute, engaging, and easy to use. I envisioned a tool that would remind owners of their pet’s needs in a way that didn’t feel like a chore but rather as an enjoyable activity. With the help of AI for research and the creation of the adorable mascot, I developed a concept that not only addresses a real problem but also brings joy to the process of caring for a beloved pet. This design case captures the creative journey and the user-focused approach I took to solve this everyday issue for pet owners.</p>

				<div class="detailParagraph">
				<h3>Design process</h3>
				<p>The first step in creating the concept was research. I opted to use AI to help me with this, significantly reducing the time spent on basic research. Since this is for a design case, I wanted to confirm that this problem existed for others as well but didn’t want to delve too deeply into the research phase.</p>
				<p>During the research, I identified three distinct personas:
					<ul>
						<li><em>The New Owner:</em> Someone who has never owned a dog before and feels overwhelmed by all the necessary care tasks for their new puppy or dog.</li>
						<li><em>The Millennial Pet Parent:</em> This group views their pets as their children and wants to provide the best care possible. The more time they can spend with their dog, the better.</li>
						<li><em>The Busy Professional:</em> A pet owner balancing a demanding career and wanting efficient, time-saving solutions for their dog's care.</li>
					</p>
				<p>For this design case, I chose to focus on <em>the Millennial Pet Parent</em> persona and designed an onboarding flow for them. I selected this persona because they have the most tasks envisioned for their pet and managing these tasks while keeping the experience light-hearted was an exciting design challenge.</p>

				<h3>Design</h3>
				<p>During the design process, I used several seductive design techniques to improve the usability of the Groomy application. These were: sequencing, shaping, and reminders.</p>

					<div id="seductive-reminders-groomy"></div>
						<div class="seductive-information">
							<h3>Reminders</h3>
							<p>When users add actievitiesm they will receive notifications on times they added themselves or during the day.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="seductive-sequencing-groomy"></div>
						<div class="seductive-information">
							<h3>Sequencing</h3>
							<p>To make sure the user doesn't get overwhelmed or confused with the amount of steps, I opted to use sequencing with a simple stepper. This shows the user where he is in the process and which and how many steps will follow.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="seductive-shaping-groomy"></div>
						<div class="seductive-information">
							<h3>Shaping</h3>
							<p>Users are affected posivively by gaining something, this can be a small achievement. By using achievement I try to shape the way they use the application and hopefully influence their behaviour positivly.</p>

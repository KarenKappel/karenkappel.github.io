			<h3>About me</h3>
			<p>As a user experience designer, I focus on the interaction between products and users. Design thinking and curiousity form the basis of my work flow. When possible I go through the different steps of the design process, favouring the exploratory, conceptualising phases and roadmapping towards future oppertunities within the project. In order to make this possible I use a set of tools: Figma(or Sketch, AdobeXD), Miro, Jira, Trello, ChatGPT. I use these for flowcharting, sketching, wireframing, designing, brainstorming and documentation for stories or projects I am working on.</p>
			<h3>Methods and research methods I use</h3>
			<div class="card-container">
					<div>
						<h3>Flowcharting</h3>
						<p>In order to understand the flow of the feature, application or tool I usually start with visualising the flows in a flowchart. This also to have a starting point with research and/or sketching in addition to having a easy visualation to share with product owners, product managers, and programmers. </p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Sketching/Wireframes</h3>
						<p>Sketching is something I do throughout the entire proces, depending on the topic at thand this could range from low-fi to high-fi sketches and eventually if needed wireframes. I favour communicating ideas and flows in mid-fi sketches, because they focus on the feature with enough detail that users and stakeholders can focus on tech or ux issues.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Tasks list</h3>
						<p>Writing down and understainding the high and low level goals forms the basis of the task list. I prefer working with a task list in combination with MoSCoW so the entire team can focus on creating a minimal viable product but don't lose sight of the wishes and needs of the users.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>User stories</h3>
						<p>User stories help focus on what the end users would like to achieve, this also helps with finding out wich features should be on the user requirement list.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>User requirement list</h3>
						<p>When sketching I like to keep the user requirement list and flowchart as a refenerence for wich features and elements should go where.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>MoSCoW</h3>
						<p>As a designer I like to focus on features that are most wanted/needed first, with this list I can easily see which features are required first.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Questionairre</h3>
						<p>In order to verify previous user research or to start user research with limitations so the the results can be used during the design process.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Interviews</h3>
						<p>Interviewing users, to get a general idea of their experience with a service or product as well as understanding their general pain points.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Card sorting</h3>
						<p>In order to find out which flow or structure users follow. With this knowlegde I can then later create a better work flow or organise information according to their mental model.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Emotional journey</h3>
						<p>Visualizing the users journey with the service or product and displaying the point where emotions are at their peak, negative and positive.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Customer journey</h3>
						<p>Visualizing the users experience and their interaction with the product or service.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Persona</h3>
						<p>I like to user personas to summarize the user research and make the results comprehensive to all stakeholders involved.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Prototyping</h3>
						<p>Creating a mockup that can be tested on the computer, with Adobe XD, Sketch, or Principle.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Usability testing</h3>
						<p>Testing with users, and non-users, is one of the most important steps during the entire process. This will give insights about the solutions and how the users think and feel anout the design.</p>

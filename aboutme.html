			<h3>About me</h3>
			<p>As a user experience designer, I focus on the interaction between products and users. When designing I go through a process to ensure the best outcome. I'm always interested and open to learning new tools, at the moment I am able work with Adobe Experience Design, Sketch, Adobe Illustrator and Principle.</p>
			<h3>Methods and research methods I use</h3>
			<div class="card-container">
				<div>
					<h3>Interviews</h3>
					<p>Interviewing users, to get a general idea of their experience with a service or product as well as understanding their general pain points.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Emotional journey</h3>
					<p>Visualizing the users journey with the service or product and displaying the point where emotions are at their peak, negative and positive.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Customer journey</h3>
					<p>Visualizing the users experience and their interaction with the product or service.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Tasks list</h3>
					<p>Writing down the main task and the sub tasks the user has to follow in oder to accomplish their goal. In order to create a better flow when users interact with a product or service.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Card sorting</h3>
					<p>In order to find out which flow or structure users follow. With this knowlegde I can then later create a better work flow or organise information according to their mental model.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Questionairre</h3>
					<p>In order to verify previous user research or to start user research with limitations so the the results can be used during the design process.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>User stories</h3>
					<p>User stories help focus on what the end users would like to achieve, this also helps with finding out wich features should be on the user requirement list.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>User requirement list</h3>
					<p>When sketching I like to keep the user requirement list and flowchart as a refenerence for wich features and elements should go where.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>MoSCoW</h3>
					<p>As a designer I like to focus on features that are most wanted/needed first, with this list I can easily see which features are required first.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Persona</h3>
					<p>I like to user personas to summarize the user research and make the results comprehensive to all stakeholders involved.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Sketching/Wireframes</h3>
					<p>Sketching ideas, wireframes and hi-fi sketches of the pages and flow of the product in order to try out new ideas and test new solutions before I start working on a mockup on the computer.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Prototyping</h3>
					<p>Creating a mockup that can be tested on the computer, with Adobe XD, Sketch, or Principle.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Usability testing</h3>
					<p>Testing with users, and non-users, is one of the most important steps during the entire process. This will give insights about the solutions and how the users think and feel anout the design.</p>

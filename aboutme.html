			<h3>About me</h3>
			<p>As a user experience designer, I focus on the interaction between products and users. Design thinking and curiosity are the foundation of my workflow. When possible, I follow the steps of the design process, favoring the exploratory and conceptualizing phases, and roadmap toward future opportunities within the project.</p>

			<p>I’ve always been fascinated by how people interact with technology. The challenge of simplifying complex user journeys, turning insights into intuitive designs, and making products enjoyable to use is what excites me most about UX design.</p>

			<p>In addition to solving UX puzzles, I love spending time outdoors with my dog, Atlas. Whether we’re hiking or just exploring the city, these experiences often inspire new ideas and give me fresh perspectives for my work.</p>

			<h3>Tools & methods</h3>
			<h4>Tools</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD for designing, prototyping, brainstorming, sketching, and wireframing.</li>
					<li>Miro for flowcharting and brainstorming or creative sessions.</li>
					<li>Jira and Trello for project and story management, and documentation.</li>
					<li>AI for streamlining workflows and conducting initial desk research.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="wrapper">
			<h4>Methods</h4>
				<p>Below is an overview of the methods I use during the design process, structured in the order I follow:</p>
			</div>
					<div class="card-container">
						<div>
								<h3>Design question</h3>
								<p>My process always starts by formulating a clear design question or challenge. This creates an environment to identify what information is already available and what needs to be gathered. It also helps align goals and involves all stakeholders from the start.</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>Research</h3>
								<p>Research is an ongoing part of my process, but I like to begin with user research and, if necessary, market research. I do this by using methods such as:
									<ul>
										<li>Analyzing market trends</li>
										<li>Reading UX theories and psychology</li>
										<li>Conducting surveys and interviews</li>
										<li>Card sorting, and other UX-research methods</li>
										<li>Usability testing</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>Defining goals and user requirement list</h3>
								<p>With insights into user needs and technical limitations, I define high-level and low-level goals and place them on a requirement list. This process involves input from different stakeholders to prioritize features using the MoSCoW method (Must-haves, Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves).</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>User stories</h3>
								<p>User stories focus on what the end users aim to achieve. This helps identify which features should be included in the user requirement list.</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>Documentation</h3>
								<p>Throughout the process, I document findings and feedback from stakeholders. I also create easy-to-digest UX documentation, such as:
									<ul>
										<li>Personas</li>
										<li>Emotional journeys</li>
										<li>Customer journeys</li>
										<li>Test reports</li>
										<li>Research outcome presentations</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>Flowcharting</h3>
								<p>Once the research phase is complete and we have a product concept, I map out the feature or application's flow using flowcharts. This helps visualize the flow for the team and serves as a reference for product owners, managers, and developers.</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>Sketching/Wireframes</h3>
								<p>Sketching is part of my entire process. Depending on the task, it can range from low-fidelity to high-fidelity sketches, eventually leading to wireframes if necessary. I prefer mid-fidelity sketches as they strike a balance between detail and flexibility for discussing ideas with stakeholders.</p>

								<h3>Desiging and prototyping</h3>
								<p>Sketching is part of my entire process. Depending on the task, it can range from low-fidelity to high-fidelity sketches, eventually leading to wireframes if necessary. I prefer mid-fidelity sketches as they strike a balance between detail and flexibility for discussing ideas with stakeholders.</p>

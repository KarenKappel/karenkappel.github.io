			<h3>Concept</h3>
			<p>This concept art was created during my intership at OVERHAUS. The backrub is a tool that helps with applying sunscreen on hard-to-reach spots on the body, it's an extension of the arm. The backrub can be used with multiple types skin care products and can be extended to the user's wish. The product is designed to be taken with a user to the beach, this means that the packaging should be able to open en close without letting sand in, and should protect the Backrub and be easy to bring with.</p>
			<p>I chose an easy disposible packaging because the backrub is foldable, this give agency to and freedom to the user on how they wish to transport their backrub. I also chose this packaging in order to convey a sense of joy and sustainablity as well as having the option open to later create a dedicated form of transportation for the product.</p>

			<h3>Concept</h3>
			<p>This concept art was created during my intership at OVERHAUS. The backrub is a tool that helps with applying sunscreen on hard-to-reach spots on the body, it's an extension of the arm. The backrub can be used with multiple types skin care products and can be extended to the user's wish. The product is designed to be taken with a user to the beach, this means that the packaging should be able to open en close without letting sand in, and should protect the Backrub and be easy to bring with.</p>
			<p>I chose to use a pouch as packaging for easy transportation and easy access to the product, a black pouch is also unisex and can be used by both men and women. I chose the colour blue for the logo to symbolise the ocean, the font was chosen by the natural feeling, like going to the beach on a warm summers day. Although I was content with the concept art during my intership, I would opt for a more natural pouch as a redesign, because this is more fitting and apropriate for a beach setting. </p>

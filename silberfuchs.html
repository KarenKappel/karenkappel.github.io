				<h3>Concept</h3>
				<p>Silberfuchs is an application that helps people track a loved one, developed by BCG ventures in Berlin. During the minor user experience design in university we were asked to add something to the application that could improve the experience of the users.</p>
				<p>Due of the nature of the application I chose to redesign the on-boarding process. This is the first interaction that the user has with the application and where valuable information get put into the application. During an analysis of the than current version I found out that users do not have the opportunity to add medication. This process is a significant opportunity to let the user fill in data that they otherwise would forget or don't know how to when they use the application for the first time.</p>
				<h3>Design process</h3>
				<p>Before I started with sketching my idea, I looked at different design patterns for different interaction point during the on boarding process. I looked at my favourite applications and at online recourses for inspiration. I then broke the process into three general steps: the signup, filling the connect code, adding the user’s medication. I also took a look at the behavioural goals so I could add an seducative principle that would help the user reach their goal.</p>
				<h4>Why the sign-up phase</h4>
				<p>Before I started with sketching my idea, I looked at different design patterns for different interaction point during the on boarding process. I looked at my favourite applications and at online recourses for inspiration. I then broke the process into three general steps: the signup, filling the connect code, adding the user’s medication. I also took a look at the behavioural goals so I could add an seducative principle that would help the user reach their goal.</p>
				<h4>The steps I focused on most</h4>
				<h5>Adding medication</h5>
				<p>The first step of the application is to add a users current medication. Adding medication can be done in diverse ways and I need to account for errors that may occur or medication that cannot be identified with scanning. Medication can also be filled in manually. The then will be added to the database. To incorporate a scanner feature, I looked at my favourite application where this already exists. This step will also trigger the system to ask for access to the camera.</p>
				<h5>Choosing medication type/form/colour</h5>
				<p>After a user has chosen a medication they can, if not automatically filled in, choose the colour and shape of the medication. If the user gets prompt form the application they can see which medication it is and take it according to plan. This releaves cognitive load by not having to remember how certain medication looks like.</p>
				<h3>Design</h3>
				<p>In order to take the design from usable to pleasurable to use, I looked at the different goals a user has. Then I categorised the goals into high-level goals and low-level goals, after that I investigated which seductive principles I could use.</p>
				<h4>High-level goals</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Create an account for a loved one</li>
					<li>Add all the medication a loved one uses.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Low-level goals</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Chooing the right medication.</li>
					<li>Using the camera to scan and add mediaction.</li>
					<li>Choosing the right moments to take medication.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In order to make the low-level goal happen I chose to use a couple of seductive principles. These were: sequencing, shaping, reminders, authority, visual imagery and humour effect.</p>
				<div class="seductive-design-explanation">
					<div id="seductive-authority"></div>
						<div class="seductive-information">
							<h3>Authority</h3>
							<p>By adding logos from the government and well-known pharmaceutical companies the user will most likely think the information given is correct and be less hesitant to use this function.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="seductive-humour"></div>
						<div class="seductive-information">
							<h3>Humour effect</h3>
							<p>When users add medication to their profile, they will receive notifications on times they have to take their medication. When users choose to fill in their medication the system will ask if it can send notifications to the user. It will also state that the application wants to remind the user in the description on the first screen.</p>

					<div id="seductive-reminders"></div>
						<div class="seductive-information">
							<h3>Reminders</h3>
							<p>When users add medication to their profile, they will receive notifications on times they have to take their medication. When users choose to fill in their medication the system will ask if it can send notifications to the user. It will also state that the application wants to remind the user in the description on the first screen.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="seductive-sequencing"></div>
						<div class="seductive-information">
							<h3>Sequencing</h3>
							<p>To make sure the user to add the type and colour of the medication I choose to use visual imagery. The user can click on a type of medication and choose a colour that resembles the medication they use. In this way the user will be recognise the look of the medication by the image and the caregivers will also recognize it when they help with the medication.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="seductive-shaping"></div>
						<div class="seductive-information">
							<h3>Shaping</h3>
							<p>Users are affected posivively by gaining something, this can be a small achievement. By using achievement I try to shape the way they use the application and hopefully influence their behaviour positivly.</p>

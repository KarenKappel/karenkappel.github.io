				<h3>Assignment</h3>
					<p>During my time at Motek MEdical I worked on three projects in total, but my main focus was the user interface for the GRAIl, M-Gait, and CAREN. These devices are used for medical research and phsyiotherapy. My assignment was to find out what users wanted and needed in a new version of the software.</p>
				
				<h4>User research</h4>
					<p>During my research of the users I used different methods to get insights and verify insights. To start of the research I interviewed seven users and created a list of insights, after which I created a customer journey and taks lists in order to see how they use the software now versus how they would like to interact woth the software to understand their mental model. After creating these, I verified the insights and asked new question to understand their motivation more with a questionnaire. After organizing the insights I created personas, a user requirement list, user stories, a new version of the flowchart and created sketches for the user interface.</p>

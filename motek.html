			<h3>Assignmet</h3>
			<p>During my time at Motek Medical I worked on three projects in total, but my main focus was the user interface for the GRAIl, M-Gait, and CAREN. These devices are used for medical research and phsyiotherapy. My assignment was to find out what users wanted and needed in a new version of the software.</p>
			<h3>User research</h3>
			<p>During my research of the users I used different methods to get insights and verify insights. To start of the research I interviewed seven users and created a list of insights, after which I created a customer journey and taks lists in order to see how they use the software now versus how they would like to interact woth the software to understand their mental model. After creating these, I verified the insights and asked new question to understand their motivation more with a questionnaire. After organizing the insights I created personas, a user requirement list, user stories, a new version of the flowchart and created sketches for the user interface.</p>
			<h3>Personas</h3>
			<p>Note that the personas are in Dutch due to the fact that my Bachelor project was in Dutch.</p>

			<h3>Design</h3>
			<p>After, and dusring, the user research I started sketching different concepts and based on the flowchart, the user requirements list, user stories, and the feedback I gathered during feedback sessions with the project manager, and the lead user experience designer. After sketching and several feedback sessions I started to create a clickable wireframe setup in Adobe Xd. I opted to create a clickable from the start, in order to find out if the flow from screen to screen was correct and would fit in the users mental model. After several feedback sessions I started the mockup with the corporate identity of Motek. I also had several feedback sessions with this mockup before I created a usability test and tested it on colleagues who interact with the users the most. Due to time restrictions on the users part there wasn't enough time left in the project to also test with them.</p>
